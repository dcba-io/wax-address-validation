# WAX Address Validation

WAX Address Validation is a small blockchain oracle for the WAX chain.

!! The demo application is NOT SECURE. No authorization module is implemented in order to provide simplicity. Donâ€™t use it directly on any network. It is only intended to show how web2.0 frontend and backend will use the contract.

The main purpose of this contract is connecting a valid and validated WAX address for a conventional Web2.0 user.

As the WAX chain is a fork of EOSIO, this contract can be used for any chain derived from EOSIO.
